[
    {
        "ID_PRESET": {       // Generated when added from an application
            "name": "PRESET_NAME", 
            "pathFrom": "",  // Folder with files for operations on them
            "pathTo": "",    // Folder where files will be transferred and copied to
            "typeFiles": "", // File types that must be present in the list
            "sizeFiles": "", // File size in kilobytes
            "wordLeft": "",  // Search for a word in the file name on the left

            "changed": "",
            "remember": []   // The name of the files that should be mandatory in the list, 
                             // this is "favorites"
